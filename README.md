# Sorting Algorithms

![Screenshot](http://www.moritzf.de/projects/img/sorting.png)

This software was developed with the aim to enrich teaching and learning in the area of algorithms with new possibilities. It is licensed under the terms of GPL v3.

The project technically is my oldest project that is available to the public. It started as an university project during my bachelor studies (2015) and was since forked into sorting-algorithms, a project which is available [here](https://github.com/teaching-algorithms/teaching-algorithms/releases).

At this point I want to thank Dr. Klaus-J. Förster and René Goertz who allowed me to develop this as a university project and contributed to its success through feedback and proposals.

Currently supported algorithms:

- Bubblesort
- Selectionsort
- Radixsort
- Quicksort
- Heapsort (Min-/Maxheap)
- Insertionsort
- Shellsort


noteworthy features:

- single step execution
- visual representation of the sorting algorithms as protocol
- generation of random numbers for sorting tasks
- LaTeX-Export
