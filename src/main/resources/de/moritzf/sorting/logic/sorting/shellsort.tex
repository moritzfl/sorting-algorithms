\underline{\bf{Computational complexity}}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l| l |}
\hline
Best Case    & Average Case  &  Worst Case\\ \hline
$O(n\cdot log(n))$ & $O(n^2)$  &  $O(n^2)$ (worst known steplength sequence) \\
& & $O(n\cdot log(n)^2)$ (best known steplength sequence) \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

WORST CASE: The conditions under which the worst case occurs depend on steplengths that are used. For Shell's originally proposed steplength sequence based on $2^n$ (eg. steplengths = [8,4,2,1]), the worst case performance may appear when the binary representation of the number of elements contains many consecutive zeroes (eg. $1024_{10} \rightarrow 10000000000_2$). This steplength-sequence leaves out uneven numbers until it gets to 1 and therefore is not the optimal choice.

BEST CASE: This occurs when the array is already sorted. Because the number of elements in the steplengths-array is $log(n)$ (again for Shell's original proposal) and for each steplength we need to confirm that the order of elements in the array is correct (in $O(n)$ as a sorted array is the best case for Insertionsort), the resulting complexity is $O(n \cdot log(n))$.


\underline{\bf{Pseudocode}}

\texttt{array}: array with numbers that are to be sorted

\texttt{steplengths}: array with steplengths that are to be used. In our definition, steplengths are arranged in descending order (eg. steplengths = [8,4,2,1]). A practical steplengths-array must further fulfill the condition $steplengths[1] < array.length$. 


\begin{lstlisting}
procedure shellsort(array, steplengths)
---------------------------------------
begin
  for each steplength in steplengths do
  begin
    for i := 1 to steplength do
    begin
  	  sort(array, i, steplength)   
    end
  end
end

procedure sort(array, i, steplength)
------------------------------------
perform Insertionsort using the following positions in the array:
 i, i  + steplength, i + steplength*2, ...
